    <h1>.NET Core Overview</h1>

    <p><strong>.NET Core</strong> is a cross-platform, open-source framework developed by Microsoft, used for building modern, high-performance applications. It is part of the larger .NET ecosystem and is widely recognized for its versatility, performance, and ability to run on multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of .NET Core</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform:</strong> .NET Core allows developers to build applications that run on different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Released under the MIT license, .NET Core is fully open-source and has an active community on GitHub.</li>
        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Optimized for performance, especially in web and cloud-based applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Unified Development Platform:</strong> Provides a consistent programming environment for web, desktop, and microservices applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightweight and Modular:</strong> Modular architecture allows developers to include only the necessary packages, leading to smaller deployments.</li>
        <li><strong>Side-by-Side Versioning:</strong> Multiple versions of .NET Core can be installed on the same machine without conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Microservices Friendly:</strong> Ideal for building microservices, especially when using containers like Docker.</li>
        <li><strong>Support for Modern Languages:</strong> Supports C#, F#, and Visual Basic with continuous improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud-Native Ready:</strong> Seamless integration with cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure for scalable cloud-based applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Security and Reliability:</strong> Provides robust security features such as authentication, authorization, and encryption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Components of .NET Core</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>.NET Core Runtime:</strong> The runtime responsible for executing applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Core Libraries:</strong> A set of standard libraries providing fundamental functionalities like file operations, collections, threading, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>SDK (Software Development Kit):</strong> Includes tools like the CLI, compilers, and package managers for building, running, and deploying applications.</li>
        <li><strong>ASP.NET Core:</strong> A web framework for building web applications, REST APIs, and real-time apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Entity Framework Core (EF Core):</strong> A modern ORM for database interaction supporting multiple providers.</li>
        <li><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI):</strong> Provides tools for creating, building, and deploying applications from the command line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Use Cases of .NET Core</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud Applications:</strong> Scalable cloud applications with Azure or AWS.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Applications:</strong> ASP.NET Core builds dynamic, high-performance web apps and APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>Microservices:</strong> Ideal for microservices architectures, often deployed in Docker containers.</li>
        <li><strong>IoT Applications:</strong> Suitable for Internet of Things solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile Backends:</strong> Serves as the backend for mobile apps using Xamarin for front-end development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History and Evolution of .NET Core</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2016:</strong> .NET Core 1.0 was released, the first open-source, cross-platform version.</li>
        <li><strong>2017:</strong> .NET Core 2.0 introduced expanded APIs and improved compatibility.</li>
        <li><strong>2019:</strong> .NET Core 3.0 added support for Windows desktop apps and further performance improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>2020:</strong> .NET 5 was released, unifying .NET Core and .NET Framework under one platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Differences Between .NET Core and .NET Framework</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Aspect</th>
                <th>.NET Core</th>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Platform Support</strong></td>
                <td>Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)</td>
                <td>Windows only</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Development Focus</strong></td>
                <td>Cloud, modern web, microservices</td>
                <td>Legacy enterprise applications</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Performance</strong></td>
                <td>High performance, lightweight</td>
                <td>Heavier with more legacy code</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Deployment</strong></td>
                <td>Self-contained, small footprint</td>
                <td>Larger, requires full framework</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Open Source</strong></td>
                <td>Fully open-source</td>
                <td>Partially open-source</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Transition to .NET 6 and Beyond</h2>
    <p>Starting from <strong>.NET 5</strong>, the "Core" branding was dropped as Microsoft unified the platform into a single framework, called simply <strong>.NET</strong>. .NET 6, released in November 2021, is a long-term support (LTS) version with performance improvements and enhanced developer experiences.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>.NET Core is a versatile, high-performance framework that is an excellent choice for developing cross-platform, cloud-native, and enterprise applications. Its continuous evolution and strong community support ensure its relevance in modern software development.</p>
